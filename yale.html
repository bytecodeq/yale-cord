you talk like motivation but live like doubt
you stay fumbled
you a draft that shoulda stayed saved
you a curse with a playlist
you post wins but collect losses
you built like broken promises
you scream “real” but act like filters
you a habit that need to end
you chase love like it's therapy
you a rerun of regret
you flex pain like it’s your only story
you shaped like a delay
you a warning in disguise
you not real you rehearsed
you the moment dreams die
you look like disappointment with data
you run from truth like it’s armed
you bark but got no reason
you built like “almost”
you the opposite of peace

prayed to a god that never woke up
eyes like fire but my soul been shut
came from the bottom where hope dont go
aint no light in my chest just smoke
lost too much to ever go broke
laugh in the face of pain like joke
i scream in silence i walk with ghosts
born in the ash where the cold wind chokes
truth got fangs and it bite like oath
been dead inside since the first one spoke
raised in the dark where the sun wont shine
grin full of teeth and a blade for a spine
they call me hell with a human design
voice like thunder but the rage aint mine
im the crack in your favorite song
im the beat that go dead when the vibe feel wrong
im the hook that make pain feel long
im the breath in the verse where the soul went gone
dont love me ill ruin the pure
got poison on lips and my smile aint sure
im the echo of the trap you endure
im the static in peace you swore
this that section eight lullaby
where hope wear chains and dreams just die
this that trench baby warcry
broke out the womb with blood in my eye
i hum like death when i walk through the room
drag my past like a nail filled tomb
love dont live here it died too soon
i carry rage like a heirloom
got cuts on my soul you cant stitch
voice sound calm but the mind still twitch
every word i spit make the air glitch
made from pain never had to switch
wrote my story with teeth and flame
burned every bridge just to carve my name
dont ask for peace i dont play that game
im the one they warn when they talk bout pain
grew up with roaches and sirens as friends
never knew love just knives in the end
hands like weapons my voice full of bends
this a war cry not a song to pretend
i talk to shadows i eat my fears
smile through blood i choke on tears
walk through the smoke with no gears
been at war for too many years
my joy got buried in concrete halls
trapped in my mind with no missed calls
woke up in flames and i danced through it all
cant break me i was born to brawl
yea cus im forever in love ever in love
baby im forever a thug ever a thug
when i said i love u i meant it in blood
when i gave my trust i gave it with mud
i came from nothing but i gave u it all
i broke my walls just to let u call
i showed u the pain that i never reveal
i gave u my soul i let it get peeled

im from the city where love aint real
where crying at night get covered in steel
i gave u a heart that i stitched with nails
i told u my past that i kept in jails
i been through hell but i smiled for u
been crossed by fam but i ride for u
they dont get me but i vibe with u
i never believed till i lied with u
i was in pain but u made that hush
world go dark but u gave that touch
life move fast and i still felt stuck
but with u i felt like i had that luck
i loved u like god wasnt watching
like angels aint warn me bout falling
like karma aint right round the corner
but i still risked it all for that calling
im still forever in love ever in pain
cant find peace so i dance in rain
i lost u once and it aint feel right
so i spin round blocks just to sleep at night
# yes they had found that boy alive all of his body parts was missing 
# yes its time to spin lets get busy fuck nigga 
i gave you my heart now im stuck with the stain
you was my peace in the middle of war
now i sleep with regrets and a glock in the drawer
i told you my secrets and you used em as ammo
now im clutching this rage in a blacked out camo
they see me and think i aint got no soul
but i gave you pieces i cant recontrol
i aint no angel i never was safe
but i held you down through the fire and hate
now you just another name in a verse
another scar that i tuck in a hearse
yea i still think bout the nights we had
back when i smiled now its just mad
you told me forever but left like the rest
now im back in the field with a hole in my chest
cant cry so i ride cant sleep so i float
tried to heal but the pain still choke
yea im forever a thug ever a thug
but deep down still wanted your love
i done gave you the world off section eight floors
still got your pic in my top drawer
im from the city where love get shot
where hearts turn cold and the real get got
i said i love you and meant it with blood
but you threw it away like it wasnt enough
now im posted in silence with demons around
gotta smile with a gun just to not break down
i remember you said i was more than a mess
now im just tryna breathe with this weight on my chest
this aint no story its facts in a beat
this that pain you feel when you cant eat
this that thuggin while your heart feel weak
this that trench baby love too deep
so yea im forever in love ever in war
tryna forget what we had before
i could run but the past still chase
so i hide every tear like it aint got place
# WHAT MAKES U THINK THAT I WOULD TRY TO RUN A GAME ON U BITCH ASS FUCKING RETARDED ASS LITTLE DUMB PUSSY ASS NIGGA 
i gave you my all but you took what you could
i trusted you deep now im misunderstood
heart full of scars but i still wear the blood
soul full of rage but i still show you love
they see the smiles but they dont know the fight
i loved you in dark i loved you in light
now i stand tall but my knees still weak
holding my pride but my soul cant speak
i came from the mud now i walk with grace
but your memory still haunts my space
i told you my truth but you chose the lies
now im out here alone with my demons and cries
love was a war but i fought with hope
now i cant trust love it’s a slippery slope
im forever in love but i walk with my pain
still searching for peace in this world full of rain
you said forever but forever was short
now im here with scars you left on my porch
i got trust issues that i carry like weight
heart locked up in a stolen crate
i ride with the real ones that never complain
but my heart still callin your name in vain
i aint afraid to die but i fear the regret
you said i was yours but i’m still feelin’ set

PULL THE THREAD IT WONT STITCH AGAIN
BURN THE CORE IT WONT BEAT AGAIN
KILL THE SIGNAL IT WONT RING AGAIN
MUTE THE ECHO IT WONT CARRY AGAIN
BURY THE SOUND IT WONT SPEAK AGAIN

you a light but when i turn you on you still clueless
you built like a missed call
your pockets so empty they echo
you got dropped by your own shadow
you the type to get curved in a therapy session
you move like a bootleg loading screen
you be breathing like your lungs confused
you smell like regret and cheap soap
your barber cutting your hair out of spite
you a section 8 soul with a dollar store mindset
you got left on delivered by destiny
you shaped like an accidental screenshot
you be lagging in real life
your dreams got an eviction notice
you look like a background character in a sandbox game
your whole fit built out of clearance racks and disappointment
you get no plays not even in practice mode
you a npc with a plotline that got deleted
you the type to lose a 1v1 to a mirror
you talk like your teeth scared of commitment
you act tough but cry when your phone dies
your wifi more stable than your emotions
you the type to stutter in text messages
your confidence on life support
you look like the inside of a roach motel
you got beef with common sense and still losing
you shaped like your mom regrets
you got cooked so bad your ancestors flinched
you a fake deep cuck who quotes horoscopes like scripture
you be rapping like you allergic to rhythm and bars
you a trench baby who never left the basement
you get friendzoned by spam accounts
you sound like a dial up tone when you speak
you built like a unpaid bill
your vibes expired in 2012
you smile like your teeth been through war
you cry in 144p
your whole life a filler episode
you got ghosted by a chatbot
you be breathing heavy after scrolling
you flex like your wallet not on food stamps
you act like you invented losing
you shaped like bad wifi
your whole fit scream i got dressed in the dark
you walk like your legs dont trust each other
you look like a skipped cutscene
you got rejected from rock bottom
you a walking glitch
you dress like you share clothes with your little brother
you built like a lost bet
your name autocorrects to disappointment
you stay getting roasted and still dont level up
your posture scream lifelong L
you talk in all caps and still sound insecure
you think you deep but got the brain of a soggy sponge
you got ghosted by your own therapist
you a nobody in surround sound
you got humbled by a fortune cookie
your voice sound like static
you dress like you live in the past
you shaped like a failed download
you been irrelevant since birth
you be struggling to win arguments with your reflection
you the type to get rejected by craigslist
you flinch when someone raises their voice
your vibe like waiting at the dmv during a storm
you so broke even your dreams in debt
you shaped like sadness
your tears got direct deposit
you the reason the party ended early
you so musty your aura visible
you look like you lost a fight to a ceiling fan
you the type to get pickpocketed by karma
you shaped like a confused meatball
you smell like the inside of a used microwave
you talk like you chew batteries
your whole life feel like a skipped ad
you built like a student loan
you look like you press skip on life tutorials
you move like you owe god a favor
your soul on section 8
you get cooked in silence and still be loud
you dress like you found your clothes in lost and found and still lost
you act like you got main character syndrome in a broken game
your aura got a factory recall
you was born with a lag spike
you shaped like a badly drawn emoji
you got beat in a 100 meter dash by a tumbleweed
your reflection dodge you out of shame
you been losing since the prologue
you shaped like a tax return denial
you a glitch in the matrix and not the cool kind
your breath sound like it scream for help
you look like a deleted tweet
you a cloud chaser in a drought
you be talking spicy but seasoning dont know you
your playlist all crying and confusion
you the punchline to your own story
you a offline soul in a online world
you built like a walking sad song
you get curved by ai generated people
you act like a main character with no plot
you so cooked you got a crust
you shaped like expired milk in a boot
you got turned down by the void
you the reason the simulation glitching
you the type of scum they scrape off the bottom of a public toilet
you not even a waste of space you a waste of oxygen and potential that never existed
you a walking reminder that some people should never have been born
you look like rock bottom had a miscarriage
you so fucking useless you lower the collective iq of everyone in the room just by breathing
you a disappointment to evolution you proof that natural selection got tired
you not even a nobody you a nothing not even worth forgetting
you so beneath me i need a shovel just to acknowledge your presence
you not just a loser you a lifetime membership holder in the hall of shame
you built like a failed suicide note walking around pretending you matter
your whole life a punchline to a joke no one tells anymore
you a stain on reality a glitch that god been tryna patch
you make cancer look like a blessing
you so miserable even hell would kick you out for lowering morale
you a roach in human skin surviving off pity and stolen air
your face look like it made a deal with the devil and still lost
you so insignificant if you vanished the universe would gain iq points
you got rejected by rock bottom and sent back up for reevaluation
you not ugly you a health hazard
your soul smells like regret and burnt bridges
you exist like a virus with no purpose just infecting peace
you a failed experiment abandoned by common sense
you talk like you chew on wires and drink from puddles
you move like your spine been replaced with shame
you the reason depression needed a new definition
you so beneath me ants look at you with disgust
your presence is an insult to potential
you a permanent L wrapped in flesh and self pity
you so fucking dumb you could drown in a shower
you a product of broken condoms and worse decisions
you the blueprint for what not to become
you built like karma forgot to finish the job
you so trash dumpsters cross the street when they see you
you got a face that could scare trauma
you the result of a bad mood and a worse night
you talk like you got bullied by your own conscience
you cry like your tears are sick of you too
you so repulsive mirrors deny your reflection
you a setback to society
you not rock bottom you under it with a sleeping bag
you bring nothing to the table not even your own chair
you a self sabotage machine with wi fi
you got no future your past dont even claim you
your parents looked at you and instantly regretted hope
you a grown stain with a birth certificate
you so fake your own thoughts don’t trust you
you was born a mistake and grew into a burden
your whole vibe smell like failure and spoiled milk
you so broke you owe your shadow rent
you dont even have enemies you beneath beef
you breathe like god’s tryna delete you in real time
you a parasite to the idea of improvement
you so embarrassing people apologize for knowing you
you got left behind by mediocrity
you the spiritual equivalent of a popped tire in the rain
you the type of person funerals forget
you so insignificant you lose in solitaire
you live like a cautionary tale but sadder
you a background blur in a life nobody’s watching
you so dumb your thoughts come with buffering
you built like punishment
you look like your dreams filed a restraining order
you move like you allergic to progress
you cry over likes and still get none
you so trash your grave gonna come with a do not recycle sign
you be talking about loyalty but snitch on yourself
you the opposite of success in every language
you stink of desperation and handouts
you not even mid you pre mid
you got the ambition of a damp napkin
you shaped like unpaid child support
you a weak ass soul with wifi connection issues
you so insecure mirrors blush out of pity
you lose arguments with your pillow
you scream potential and never deliver
you was never him never close to him never knew him
you the definition of a cautionary google search
your mind run on windows 95
you a crash test dummy that failed the crash
your entire life a deleted tweet
you built like you get ignored in group therapy
you so far beneath me i need to teleport to even care
you one step away from being forgotten on purpose
your life story a horror movie with no climax
you not a man you a maybe
you a lowercase l disguised as a person
you so cooked your mama flinched when she saw you
you the reason the light turned off at the end of the tunnel
you get clowned in purgatory
your entire existence is a cry for help in a language nobody speaks
you not in your bag you in a ditch

you talk like your mouth got laid off
your existence feel like waiting for a ride that never came
you shaped like a prayer that never reached

you shaped like if depression had a mascot
you got skipped in the evolution update
you cry like the sound of failure learning to sing
you not even hated you just not worth emotion
you was born at the wrong time in the wrong body with the wrong chances
you the reason the reaper takes naps
your aura feel like a blocked number
you the opposite of value
you breathe and positivity files a complaint
you look like hope got scammed
you shaped like a draft that shouldve stayed unsent
you so unimportant even misery forgets your name
you was born during a glitch
you talk like sorrow got tired halfway through
you built like the last straw in someone else's breakdown
you so lame pain took a day off
your entire vibe copyrighted by regret
you the echo of a mistake that still rings loud
you not built different you built defective
